              I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at Columbia University, and am advised by <a
                href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~simha/" class="link-class" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">Simha Sethumadhavan</a>.
              My research is focused on taking a technology-first approach towards identifying, measuring, and
              distributing the costs of computer security. I use a big-picture definition of "costs" but am particularly
              interested in the systems-level tradeoffs between security and performance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some of the work I've done towards this end:
            </p>
            <p><b>Can we utilize computer architecture and systems design to lower the performance costs of security
                operations?</b>
              I designed <a href="#checkpointing" class="link-class">novel L1/L2 cache protocols</a> to leverage in-line
              cache compression for reducing program checkpoint + recovery times. I also leveraged system checkpointing
              for crafting dynamic runtime security seccomp filters on Linux systems.</p>

            <p><b>Why are the same few vulnerabilities (like buffer overflows) exploited year-after-year when we have
                the technical means to solve them?</b> I have been advocating for viewing security as sociotechnical
              problem to illustrate why technical security failures persist, and <a href="#doctrine"
                class="link-class">developed a framework for identifying where and how to distribute the "shared burden"
                of security</a>.</p>

            <p><b>What is the opportunity cost of exchanging performance for security?</b> I built <a href="#wta"
                class="link-class">desktop and web apps that experimentally quantify the dollar amount that users place
                on device performance</a>.</p>

            <p><b>How can we make security cheap and available for everyone?</b> I researched auth protocols (FIDO2/U2F)
              to determine the feasibility of building open source hardware authenticator devices.</p>

            <p><b>Can we leverage computer architecture and systems design to avoid "security theater" regulations?</b>
              I demonstrated the feasibility of <a href="#mandates" class="link-class">using neural networks to estimate
                the in situ performance overhead of security</a>. Using this primitive, I designed a regulatory system
              that provisions a system-level security "budget" and incentivizes the efficient use of security resources
              (like CPU cycles or power).</p>

            <p><b>What techniques from economics research can we use to study the costs of security?</b> I'm currently
              using game theory and simulation methods to understand the tradeoffs of security investments.</p>
            <!-- <p>
              My Ph.D. has focused on methods and mechanisms to improve security from the ground-up through secure systems and hardware.
              I started my Ph.D. trying to leverage <a href="#checkpointing" class="link-class">in-line cache compression to accelerate
                  system checkpointing</a>.
              This led to (unpublished) work on an encryption-based Rowhammer defense;
              the technique didn't pan out but it led to an important conclusion:
              it doesn't matter how many defenses researchers design if they
              never get built in real products!
            </p> -->
            <!-- <p>
              Since then, my research has grappled with this question:
              <a href="#doctrine" class="link-class">
              What can technologists do to improve security when the roadblocks are not just technical ones</a>?
              This has been a multi-pronged approach:
              I first needed to understand the tradeoffs between performance and security,
              so I conducted <a href="#wta" class="link-class">experiments that measure how much users value performance</a>.
              To do this, I developed software that had study participants decide between money and performance with real-world consequences. 
              Later, I delved into how regulation might kickstart security adoption in systems.
              <a href="#mandates" class="link-class">Our proposal asks systems to spend a fraction of execution cycles on security</a> 
              but lets product vendors themselves figure out how this budget should be spent. 
              To make such a proposal enforceable, I trained a neural network that estimates real-time security overhead based on on-chip hardware events (i.e. HPC data).
              I also did some industry internships that focused on embedded systems security,
              authentication, and applied cryptography.
              I am currently working on modeling cyberinsurance as a mechanism to improve
              security adoption.
