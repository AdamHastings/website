          <p>
            I am a Ph.D. candidate at Columbia University in Department of Computer Science.
            I work in the areas of systems and security and am advised by Simha Sethumadhavan. 
          </p>
          <p>
            My Ph.D. has focused on methods and mechanisms to improve security from the ground-up.
            I started my Ph.D. by trying to leverage in-line cache compression to accelerate system checkpointing to enable fast speculation recovery and provide space for security metadata. 
            This led to some (unpublished) work on using encryption to defend against Rowhammer; 
            the technique didn't pan out but it led me to an important conclusion:
            It doesn't matter how many Rowhammer/memory safety/Spectre/etc. defenses researchers come up with if they never get built in real-world products! 
          </p>  
          <p>  
            Since then, my research has grappled with this question: 
            What can technologists do to improve security when the roadblocks to security are largely economic ones, and not solely technical ones? 
            This has been a multi-pronged approach: 
            I first needed to understand the tradeoffs invovled when architects forgo performance in exchange for security.
            This led me to conduct user studies that quantify how much users value device performance in terms of US dollars. 
            Later, I delved into how regulation might kickstart security adoption in hardware and systems. 
            This is a very challenging problem filled with many perverse incentives and must be done very carefully;
            we propose applying a "security tax" on systems and letting product vendors themselves figure out how to allocate system resources for security (rather than rely on regulators to make these highly technical and nuanced decisions). 
            As part of this work, I created a neat neural network regression technique to leverage hardware performance counters (HPCs) to measure how many execution cycles a system is spending on security <i>in real time</i>.
            I also took an extended industry internship detour and focused for a while on embedded systems security, authentication, and applied cryptography.
            Finally, I am currently working on modeling and understanding cyberinsurance as a mechanism to improve security adoption.
