              I am a recently-defended Ph.D. graduate from the Department of Computer Science at Columbia University, where I had the incredible fortune of being advised by <a
                href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~simha/" class="link-class" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Simha Sethumadhavan</a>.
              My research is focused on taking a technology-first approach towards identifying, measuring, and
              distributing the costs of computer security. I use a big-picture definition of "costs" but am particularly
              interested in the systems-level tradeoffs between security and performance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some of the work I've done towards this end:
            </p>
            <p><b>Can we utilize computer architecture and systems design to lower the performance costs of security
                operations?</b>
              I designed <a href="#checkpointing" class="link-class">novel L1/L2 cache protocols</a> to leverage in-line
              cache compression for reducing program checkpoint + recovery times. I also leveraged system checkpointing
              for crafting dynamic runtime security seccomp filters on Linux systems.</p>

            <p><b>Why are the same few vulnerabilities (like buffer overflows) exploited year-after-year when we have
                the technical means to solve them?</b> I have been advocating for viewing security as sociotechnical
              problem to illustrate why technical security failures persist, and <a href="#doctrine"
                class="link-class">developed a framework for identifying where and how to distribute the "shared burden"
                of security</a>.</p>

            <p><b>What is the opportunity cost of exchanging performance for security?</b> I built software to <a href="#wta"
                class="link-class">experimentally quantify the dollar value of device performance</a>.</p>

            <p><b>How can we make security cheap and available for everyone?</b> I researched auth protocols (FIDO2/U2F)
              to determine the feasibility of building open source hardware authenticator devices.</p>

            <p><b>Can we leverage computer architecture and systems design to avoid "security theater" regulations?</b>
              I demonstrated the feasibility of <a href="#mandates" class="link-class">using neural networks to estimate
                the in situ performance overhead of security</a>. Using this primitive, I designed a regulatory system
              that provisions a system-level security "budget" and incentivizes the efficient use of security resources
              (like CPU cycles or power).</p>

            <p><b>How do we know which cybersecurity policies are worth pursuing?</b>
              <!-- Is it better to require organizations to make investments into security posture? Or to protect their wealth with cyber insurance? Without the ability to answer such questions scientifically, it is difficult to know a priori which policies will provide the most benefit. -->
            My most recent work uses a large-scale economic model of cybersecurity using game theory and multi-agent simulation to allow for a quantitative experiment-based approach towards crafting cyber policy. You can try out a demo of this work <a href="https://cyberspending.cs.columbia.edu/" class="link-class" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
            This work will appear at Usenix Security Symposium '25.</p>
            <!-- <p>
              My Ph.D. has focused on methods and mechanisms to improve security from the ground-up through secure systems and hardware.
              I started my Ph.D. trying to leverage <a href="#checkpointing" class="link-class">in-line cache compression to accelerate
                  system checkpointing</a>.
              This led to (unpublished) work on an encryption-based Rowhammer defense;
              the technique didn't pan out but it led to an important conclusion:
              it doesn't matter how many defenses researchers design if they
              never get built in real products!
            </p> -->
            <!-- <p>
              Since then, my research has grappled with this question:
              <a href="#doctrine" class="link-class">
              What can technologists do to improve security when the roadblocks are not just technical ones</a>?
              This has been a multi-pronged approach:
              I first needed to understand the tradeoffs between performance and security,
              so I conducted <a href="#wta" class="link-class">experiments that measure how much users value performance</a>.
              To do this, I developed software that had study participants decide between money and performance with real-world consequences. 
              Later, I delved into how regulation might kickstart security adoption in systems.
              <a href="#mandates" class="link-class">Our proposal asks systems to spend a fraction of execution cycles on security</a> 
              but lets product vendors themselves figure out how this budget should be spent. 
              To make such a proposal enforceable, I trained a neural network that estimates real-time security overhead based on on-chip hardware events (i.e. HPC data).
              I also did some industry internships that focused on embedded systems security,
              authentication, and applied cryptography.
              I am currently working on modeling cyberinsurance as a mechanism to improve
              security adoption.
